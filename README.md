# social-media-app
Social Media App that fetches your most recent music, tweets, videos, posts, and listings. Uses Spotify, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Etsy APIs.

**Notice**: This is a proof-of-concept.

## Usage
1. Copy code into a directory that is served via a classic WAMP stack.
2. Create accounts with each platform and obtain the necessary keys to include in `auth-shell.php`.

## Warning
Most of the code displaying recent media is now broken due to API changes made by social media platforms and will need updates to make it work.
